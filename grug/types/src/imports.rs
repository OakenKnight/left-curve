//! This file describes the import API that the host provides to Wasm modules.
//!
//! Three types of import functions are provided:
//!
//! - database reads/writes,
//! - cryptography methods, and
//! - a method for querying the chain.
//!
//! These functions are abstracted into the `Storage`, `Api`, and `Querier`
//! traits.

mod api;
mod querier;
mod storage;
